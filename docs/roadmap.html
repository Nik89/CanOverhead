<h2>[1.3.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD frames with only one bitrate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Radio button to select between CAN and CAN FD frames for 11 and 29 bit IDs.<ul>
<li>RTR frames are not available in FD mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adapted computation of the CAN frame bits to support extended CAN FD frames.</li>
<li>Effective bitrate and transfer speed computed with the assumption that
  the payload bitrate is equal to the arbitration bitrate.</li>
<li>Default bitrates list extended on the upper end, adding: 5 Mbit/s, 2 Mbit/s</li>
</ul>
<h2>[1.4.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD with flexible data-rate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for CAN FD with payload bitrate different than then arbitration
  bitrate.<ul>
<li>Bitrate can also be provided by the user instead of using one of the
  default ones from the list above</li>
<li>Bitrate can be expressed in multiple of 1024 (kibibit, Mebibit etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
