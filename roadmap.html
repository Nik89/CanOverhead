<h1>Roadmap</h1>
<p>All planned changes to this project will be documented in this file.</p>
<p>The format is based on
<a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/">Keep a Changelog</a>,
and this project adheres to
<a href="https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>[0.1.0]</h2>
<p>Frame size estimate when ID and data are not known.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classic CAN with 11-bit IDs with only the payload length known:</li>
<li>Compute the size in bits of the whole frame (header, payload, trailer)
    without stuff bits.</li>
<li>Compute the size range in bits of the whole frame when taking also
    stuff bits into account (min = no stuff bits applied, max = max stuff
    bits applied for CAN ID and payload).</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.2.0]</h2>
<p>Exact frame, CRC and bit stuffing when ID and data are known.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classic CAN with 11-bit IDs with the CAN ID and payload content known:</li>
<li>CAN ID input accepted in binary format, e.g. <code>0010010</code>.</li>
<li>Payload content input accepted in binary format, e.g. <code>100010011101...</code>.</li>
<li>Compute and display the whole frame as bits (header, payload, trailer)
    with format <code>0110 1011 | 1001 1000 | ...</code> without stuff bits.
    The computation of the <a href="https://www.can-cia.org/can-knowledge/can/crc/">CRC</a>
    is included in the computation of the trailer.</li>
<li>Same as previous point but with stuff bits included.</li>
<li>Compute and display the exact amount of added stuff bits.</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.3.0]</h2>
<p>More input formats accepted.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Display of the whole frame also in hexadecimal format, padded with zero-bits
  to the right to the nearest multiple of 8. Display also the amount of
  padding bits added (radio button or similar to select input type).</li>
<li>CAN ID input accepted also in decimal and hexadecimal format,
  e.g. <code>42</code> or <code>11A</code> (radio button or similar to select input type)</li>
<li>Payload content input accepted (radio button or similar to select input type)
  also as comma-separated list of bits,
  e.g. <code>1,0,1,1</code>, or hexadecimal, e.g. <code>0b12</code>. Case insensitive, zero-padding
  to the left required so <code>b12</code> is invalid.</li>
<li>Make stuff bits bold in the provided output</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.4.0]</h2>
<p>Bitrates and transfer time.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitrates list available: 1 Mbit/s, 800, 500, 250, 125, 50, 20, 10 kbit/s</li>
<li>Calculation of gross/net (effective) bitrate:</li>
<li>exact when exact ID and payload is given</li>
<li>range when the ID and payload are not known</li>
<li>Calculation of gross/net (effective) transfer time:</li>
<li>exact when exact ID and payload is given</li>
<li>range when the ID and payload are not known</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.5.0]</h2>
<p>29-bit CAN IDs.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for 29-bit CAN IDs (radio button or similar to select between 11
  and 29 bits). Same features as above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>[0.6.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD with fixed datarate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for CAN FD with payload datarate equal to the arbitration
  datarate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>[1.0.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD with flexible datarate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for CAN FD with payload datarate different than then
  arbitration datarate.</li>
</ul>
