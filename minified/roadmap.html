<h2>[1.2.0]</h2>
<p>Bitrates and transfer time.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bitrates list available: 1 Mbit/s, 800, 500, 250, 125, 50, 20, 10, 5 kbit/s</li>
<li>Bitrate can also be provided by the user instead of using one of the
    default ones from the list above</li>
<li>Calculation of gross/net (effective) bitrate:</li>
<li>exact when exact ID and payload is given</li>
<li>range when the ID and payload are not known</li>
<li>Calculation of gross/net (effective) transfer time:</li>
<li>exact when exact ID and payload is given</li>
<li>range when the ID and payload are not known</li>
<li>Info popups explaining what all of these fields are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>[1.3.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD frames with only one bitrate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Radio button to select between CAN and CAN FD frames for 11 and 29 bit IDs.</li>
<li>RTR frames are not available in FD mode.</li>
<li>Adapted computation of the CAN frame bits to support extended CAN FD frames.</li>
<li>Effective bitrate and transfer speed computed with the assumption that
  the payload bitrate is equal to the arbitration bitrate.</li>
<li>Default bitrates list extended on the upper end, adding: 5 Mbit/s, 2 Mbit/s</li>
</ul>
<h2>[1.4.0]</h2>
<p>CAN FD with flexible data-rate.</p>
<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
<li>Support for CAN FD with payload bitrate different than then arbitration
  bitrate.</li>
</ul>
